# Median Salary by Age: Python vs JavaScript Developers

This project analyzes the median salaries of Python developers, JavaScript developers, and all developers across different ages, using data visualization. The goal is to compare salary trends and see how different programming languages impact earnings as developers progress in their careers.

## Project Overview

In this project, a line graph is created using the `matplotlib` library to visualize the median salary (in USD) of developers based on their age. The data includes salary information for:
- Python Developers
- JavaScript Developers
- All Developers

The graph displays how the median salary changes with age and how the salaries of Python and JavaScript developers compare to those of all developers.

## Features
- Visualizes median salaries of developers based on age.
- Compares salary trends for Python and JavaScript developers.
- Uses Python and `matplotlib` to generate a line graph for easy comparison.
- Saves the plot as a PNG image (`plot.png`).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/median-salary-by-age.git
